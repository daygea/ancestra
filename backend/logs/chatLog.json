It is unique to the city and is widely believed to be the forerunner of the modern day carnival in Brazil. The Eyo festival, otherwise known as the Adamu Orisha Play, is staged in honor of deceased Lagos traditional rulers and notable personalities. It also marks the end of the yearly Eyo Festival.\n\nDuring the festival, participants wear a wide-brimmed hat, which is known as an 'agbada', covering their entire body. The Eyo festival is also a tourist attraction. It's a very colorful parade and a sight to behold. \n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about Yoruba tradition or spirituality?",

His name means \"King of the Earth\" and he is often appealed to for healing and protection against disease. Despite his association with illness, Obaluaye is a highly respected and revered deity for his power over life and death.",
